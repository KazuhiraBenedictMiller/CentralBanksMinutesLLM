This had been a puzzling set of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfigures, particularly when set against recent indicators of strength such as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour market conditions. On the international front, recent data were suggesting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat overall growth next year would be lower than the very strong 2006 outcome,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut still higher than average, even with a slowdown in the US economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\nInternational Conditions\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the United States, employment growth in the past few months had eased to a rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslightly below trend. The unemployment rate had levelled out at just over 4½\xa0per\xa0cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDevelopments in the labour market had typically been a good gauge of the business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcycle, suggesting that the economy was experiencing a slowing at present. In\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tview of the rising inflationary pressures in recent months, some slowing was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta healthy development; the main question was about its extent. For the moment,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe best assessment was that growth was easing to a pace just below trend.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, with inflation still relatively high, the period ahead would be uncomfortable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the Federal Reserve. While the headline inflation rate was set to fall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom around 4\xa0per\xa0cent in the months ahead following the recent sharp\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfall in oil prices, the core measure, which excluded food and energy prices,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad trended up in recent months. This measure was currently around 3\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton an annualised basis and recent monthly rates had not shown any signs of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were conscious that as the unwinding of the housing boom in the US could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave unpredictable consequences, including significant adverse effects on household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspending, the high-frequency data needed to be monitored carefully in the period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tahead. In August, housing permits and starts were around 20\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow the peak six months earlier, but the extent of any further decline was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to be a function of how much overbuilding had occurred in the upswing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the previous several years. Consumer spending was also being dampened\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the declining or levelling out of house prices at present, but fears of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta ‘hard landing’ being driven by the housing sector were regarded\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas exaggerated at this stage. Economy-wide indicators suggested that the softening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin conditions was not as sharp as for the housing sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Japan, the Tankan survey, conducted by the Bank of Japan, indicated that business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions were trending up to levels comparable to those prevailing prior\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the recessionary period. In the corporate sector, profits, which had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trising since the mid to late 1990s, had been used to retire debt; in the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfew months lending to businesses had been growing for the first time in well\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover a decade.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in industrial production in China remained high, suggesting no change to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutlook for ongoing strong growth in output. There continued to be some doubts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the quality of the Chinese economic data. With anecdotal evidence of rising\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcosts in the coastal cities owing to rapid demand growth, prices for Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texports would need careful watching.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnother fast-growing part of the world economy was India, where output growth was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t9\xa0per\xa0cent over the year to mid 2006. In the past few years growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad stepped up from 6\xa0per\xa0cent to around 8–9\xa0per\xa0cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBoth China and India had significantly increased their shares of the world economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand world trade over the past decade. In particular, with average growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP of 9\xa0per\xa0cent over the 10 years to 2005, China's share of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe world economy had reached over 15\xa0per\xa0cent on a PPP basis. In\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe case of India, average growth of 6\xa0per\xa0cent per annum had seen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits share of the world economy reach 6\xa0per\xa0cent in 2005. Population\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrends were likely to boost the relative importance of India in the global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy for some time. India's population growth rate was more than double\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat of China, and by 2030 India would overtake China in terms of population\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccording to official projections. Accompanying these broader trends had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta marked increase in both countries' share of Australia's exports.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers expressed interest in seeing trade figures by sector for these countries,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich were of growing importance to Australia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe euro area was experiencing better economic conditions than in recent years. Industrial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction and measures of consumer and business sentiment had all trended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup over the past year or so.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor the world economy as a whole, growth was set to slow from about 5\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin 2006 to 4½\xa0per\xa0cent in 2007, according to Consensus forecasts,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut this would still be above average. However, members noted that if the US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy slowed more noticeably than currently expected, this could well spread\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the world economy more broadly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCrude oil prices had fallen in the previous few weeks, to close to US$60 per barrel,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas tensions in the Middle East had eased further. There had been signs of demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoftening together with some positive news on oil discoveries. It was also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely that market dynamics had acted to correct part of the overshoot in prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround the middle of the year. Futures prices for oil were flat around the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurrent spot price. If sustained, the latest developments in oil prices would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treduce the December quarter CPI in Australia by around ½ of a percentage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoint.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDomestic Conditions\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe focus of discussion on domestic economic conditions was initially on how to reconcile\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe lower-than-expected GDP growth rate reported for the June quarter and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear to June with other indicators that had shown rising growth rates in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst half of 2006. Although the national accounts for the most recent few\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarters were estimates and could be subject to significant revision, the data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad posed a number of puzzles. It was noteworthy that all three measures of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP had indicated a slowing in growth to around 2\xa0per\xa0cent for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear to the June quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn looking at sources of growth in the June quarter and over the past year, members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that consumption growth had been moderate, dwelling investment appeared\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be levelling out and business investment had continued to grow strongly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWith public demand growing above trend, this implied that growth in domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinal demand had continued to be robust. GDP growth was relatively low because\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand growth had been met by a decline in inventories and ongoing rapid growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin imports. The inventories data were of low quality and prone to substantial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevision, so there was likely to be some reversal of the drag from growth from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat source in the near term.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn contrast to the data on output growth, conditions in the labour market had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong during the first half of the year, with strong employment growth and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta further slight decline in the unemployment rate. The contrast between GDP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand employment trends had persisted for the past 2½ years. Employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased at an above-trend pace since the end of 2003 but during that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod GDP growth had been lower than the average for the current expansion.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOther data on the labour market, e.g. for vacancies, were consistent with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrength in employment, so while some element of overstatement was possible\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin employment growth or hours worked, it was not likely to be significant.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe implied sharp slowdown in productivity growth appeared implausible. Despite\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta number of possible explanations being canvassed, members felt that the conundrum\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof relatively slow output growth and high employment growth remained. They\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that growth in nominal GDP had been very rapid, owing in part to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trising terms of trade, and this had supported buoyant growth in government\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevenues. However, it was acknowledged that the measurement errors involved\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin converting nominal to real magnitudes in measuring GDP growth could be greater\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan usual at present, given the large changes in relative prices taking place.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to indicators of economic activity in the September quarter, the NAB survey\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof non-farm businesses suggested that business conditions had remained high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter the middle of the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the household sector, conditions appeared likely to support continued moderate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in spending. Falling fuel prices had been a factor favouring further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth, along with tax cuts and growth in wages and employment, though these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been partly offset by the effect of the recent increases in interest rates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTaking all these factors into account, real household disposable income was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trising at around 3\xa0per\xa0cent, while nominal retail spending appeared\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be rising at around 6\xa0per\xa0cent per annum. Consumer sentiment,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone of the few indicators post-dating the August rate rise, in September had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecovered about two-thirds of the sharp fall in August and was now around the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlong-run average level. Households spent 11\xa0per\xa0cent of disposable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincome on debt servicing in the June quarter. The rising share of households\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had an exposure to the investment property market over time had contributed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta substantial proportion of the rise in total debt-servicing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe housing construction sector was close to a trough. With approvals and commencements\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trunning below trend, this implied that the growing backlog would support growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin construction activity. Moreover, vacancy rates, which were at relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlow levels, had fallen further in recent quarters. Across the country, there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been a large cumulative downturn in New South Wales but thus far no downturn\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Western Australia, which was the part of the country benefiting most from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe resources boom. In the period ahead, it was likely that aggregate housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity would shift from being a negative to a mildly positive influence on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the secondary housing market had been firm, though there were some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsigns of softness in the most recent data. House prices had appeared to increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup to around the middle of the year, but since then there had been some tentative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevidence of a stabilisation. The rapid growth in house prices in Perth over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past several years was quite different from that seen in the other capitals,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere prices had been flat between the end of 2003 and the end of 2005 and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisen mildly since then. Auction clearance rates were a little lower in August,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth in Sydney and Melbourne.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHousehold credit growth had increased around the middle of the year, but since then\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad eased back to around 1\xa0per\xa0cent per month. Finance approvals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been lower in the past two months, which suggested that the more moderate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit growth would continue in the near term.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness investment rose in the June quarter but year-ended growth eased to around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t11\xa0per\xa0cent. Further slowing in growth was likely, but the high level\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof investment in the economy nonetheless implied a significant contribution\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the growth in productive capacity. Business credit growth had been rising,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto about 16\xa0per\xa0cent per annum.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the exports sector, receipts had been trending up. This had mostly reflected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trising export prices but export volumes had increased by 1½\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the June quarter. Further growth in export volumes was expected in the year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor two ahead given the extent of new capacity put in place in the past few\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears. However, the outlook for rural exports was poor given continued dry\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions across most of the country.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCommodity prices had remained high in recent months. Base metals prices, which appeared\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have peaked in May, had been broadly stable over recent months at a level\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround 50\xa0per\xa0cent higher than at the start of the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board was briefed on the revised forecasts for output growth and inflation that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been prepared for the meeting. The outlook for underlying inflation was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor it to remain close to its recent level of around 3\xa0per\xa0cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis would be reviewed following the prices data to become available during\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFinancial Markets and the Bank's Operations\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been no changes to official interest rates in the major countries in September.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCurrent policy rates in these countries were 5.25\xa0per\xa0cent in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS, 3.0\xa0per\xa0cent in the euro area and 0.25\xa0per\xa0cent in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJapan. Commentary from the Federal Reserve suggested that there may be a need\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor further rises in official interest rates to contain inflationary pressure,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough the markets were of the view that interest rates had peaked.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDuring the month, longer-term market interest rates fell noticeably in most countries.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMuch of this was sourced to the US, where markets considered that the weakness\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the housing sector could translate to a general slowing of the economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLower yields were supported by falling oil prices, which held out the prospect\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof lower inflation. Yields on 10-year bonds in the US fell to 4.6\xa0per\xa0cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t60\xa0basis\xa0points lower than three months earlier. A fall of this magnitude\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas not unprecedented, but the fact that bond yields were now lower than the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfed funds rate was significant. On previous occasions when this had occurred\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the past decade, it had been a precursor to policy easing by the Fed. It\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas not clear that this was the right interpretation on this occasion as a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of structural factors, in particular strong capital flows from Asia,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere still pushing bond yields down.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBond yields in other markets did not fall by as much as in the US. In both Europe\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Japan, bond yields remained well above the respective official interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe US share market was relatively strong in September, rising by a further 2\xa0per\xa0cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand prices had exceeded the peak in May. Expectations that lower oil prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould reduce inflationary pressures were an important factor behind the market's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrength, but lower bond yields may also have been supporting higher share\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvaluations.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExchange rates had continued to be stable during September. The US dollar was little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanged on a trade-weighted basis in the month, and had shown little net change\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past two years. The main development in foreign exchange markets in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent months had been the weakening of the yen, despite the improving prospects\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the Japanese economy. Whereas in most countries a stronger economy was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassociated with a rising exchange rate, growing confidence of Japanese financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstitutions had been encouraging them to take on more risk and increase their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment offshore, pushing the yen down. These capital outflows by institutions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave been accompanied by higher investment offshore by Japanese households,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseeking the relatively higher yields abroad.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, the rate of appreciation of the renminbi exchange rate had increased. It\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad taken almost a year to appreciate from 8.1 to the US dollar to 8.0, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin only three months the renminbi had moved from 8.0 to 7.9.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the past month, emerging markets were subject to several potentially unsettling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevents, but none seemed to have had a significant impact. An example was the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmilitary coup in Thailand, which could have been negative for financial markets.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs it turned out, the exchange rate, share market and bond spreads were not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch affected. Similarly, some political instability in emerging European countries\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Latin America did not affect bond spreads in these markets.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Australia, there had been little change in short-term interest rates during the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast month, though six-month money market yields declined slightly. Expectations\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof further tightening of monetary policy declined to only a 30\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchance by the end of the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLong-term interest rates in Australia had fallen, to around 5.6\xa0per\xa0cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough not to the same extent as in the US. The yield curve was inverse, i.e.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith long-term yields below the cash rate. Unlike in the US, this had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe case for much of the past 18 months, and it was difficult to extract from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit much of significance for policy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian share market had been relatively flat in September, reflecting some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweakening in the prices of resource stocks, and as a result had underperformed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe major markets overseas. A similar development had occurred in countries\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere resource stocks carried a high weighting in the share market, e.g. Canada.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrices of resource stocks were still noticeably below the peak in May, whereas\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices of financial and industrial company stocks had mostly recovered the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMay peaks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe corporate profit reporting season had largely ended. Overall, underlying profits\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof ASX200 companies were 35\xa0per\xa0cent higher than in the June 2005\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thalf-year. Much of the growth in profits had come from resource companies,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhose profits increased by 72\xa0per\xa0cent, but profit increases had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen broadly based: 70\xa0per\xa0cent of the top 200 listed companies had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treported higher profits. Financial stocks had reported a 19\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trise in profits, while other industrial companies had reported a modest increase.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnalysts have reduced their estimates of profit increases for the current and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnext financial years, mainly because of revised expectations for profit growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof resource companies. This represented a change in the recent trend, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been for profits to be progressively revised up.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian dollar had fallen slightly both against the US dollar and in trade-weighted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms, but remained well within its recent range. The Australian dollar had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen more stable recently than either the Canadian or New Zealand dollars.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe latter had risen quite sharply in the past few months but remained below\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe level reached late in 2005.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard members were informed about some recent developments in hedge funds. In particular,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe losses by Amaranth Advisors, which, at US$6 billion, were the largest since\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe collapse of LTCM in 1998, had caused remarkably little repercussion on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial markets, apart from gas futures. The lack of any wider contagion\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom these large losses was attributed to the overall size of the market and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe dispersion of risks. Some facts about the Australian hedge fund industry\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere also outlined. Despite being the largest in Asia, the local industry was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill small in absolute terms. Members noted that, under Australian arrangements,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thedge funds were subject to the same regulations as any other fund manager,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta better arrangement than in the US, where a lesser degree of disclosure applied\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto hedge funds. Members also noted that the credit exposures of local banks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto hedge funds were relatively low, and were monitored by APRA.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\nConsiderations for Monetary Policy\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recommendation to the Board was for no change in the cash rate in October.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board noted that over the past month there had been further evidence that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomposition of economic growth across countries was shifting, but that overall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth, while likely to slow somewhat in 2007, would still be solid. Growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the domestic economy in the first half of the year had been disappointing,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough it had been difficult to reconcile the estimate of low growth in GDP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith robust growth in employment and indications of a tight labour market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had still been only limited data that post-dated the increase in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcash rate in August.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers felt that it was very important to resist the current period of relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh inflation and to ensure that inflation expectations were contained. With\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe staff forecast of inflation of around 3\xa0per\xa0cent remaining uncomfortably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh, the Board considered whether there was a case to tighten monetary policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagain this month. However, given the preceding discussion on current economic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions in the world economy and Australia, and allowing that the degree\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof slowing in growth shown by the national accounts potentially contained some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenuine infonnation, the Board judged that the case to tighten further was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tno stronger than it had been in the previous month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNoting that several key data releases were scheduled for the month ahead, importantly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding the September quarter CPI, the Board judged that a clearer assessment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the need for any further tightening could be made at the November meeting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Decision\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board decided that the cash rate should remain at 6.0\xa0per\xa0cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Back to top\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for email and SMS alerts\nSubscribe\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\nFlickr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiliate sites\n\nBanknotes\nUnreserved\nMuseum\nCouncil of Financial Regulators\nAustralian Foreign Exchange Committee\nH.C.
