After five years of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpansion, an easing in GDP growth was needed in order to prevent inflationary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressures from rising further. Growth in non-farm payrolls, which had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong during the period of economic expansion, had also moderated in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths. However, the unemployment rate had continued to trend down, and at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4.4\xa0per\xa0cent in October, was close to previous low points at the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tend of the 1990s expansion.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recent slowing in the US economy mainly reflected the downturn in the housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector, with starts and permits to build up to September about 20\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower than the peak six months earlier. If these indicators stabilised around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurrent levels, this would take about 1 percentage point from overall growth,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgiven that housing accounted for 5\xa0per\xa0cent of economic activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the US. There was some tentative evidence that the decline in housing construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity was levelling out, but further falls were possible as were flow-on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffects to other parts of the economy, notably consumption. At this stage,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother parts of the economy were in good shape, with retail sales, for example,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaintaining growth at a pace above 7\xa0per\xa0cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHeadline inflation in the US had declined to just over 2\xa0per\xa0cent, reflecting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsharp falls in gasoline prices in the past month or so. Core inflation, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texcludes food and energy prices, had risen from 2\xa0per\xa0cent to just\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunder 3\xa0per\xa0cent over the past six months, the highest rate for 15\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears. There had been some declines in the most recent monthly core inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata, but the current annual rate still posed a level of discomfort for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe key issue at present was whether the slowing in the US economy was going to spread\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore widely around the world, or whether there was sufficient strength in other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies to maintain a good pace of growth overall. At this stage, the evidence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill supported the latter view.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been little new information over the past month on current economic conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Japan. The expansion in growth was continuing, but core inflation remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow zero, which was making the Bank of Japan cautious in its desire to tighten\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonetary policy further. The business sector was in good shape and the labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket was showing signs of increasing strength, with employment rising steadily\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the job-offers-to-applicants ratio above 1 for the past few months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, year-ended GDP growth for the September quarter had remained above 10\xa0per\xa0cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough it was a little slower than in the previous quarter. Elsewhere in east\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAsia, growth had been solid over the year to the June quarter at around 5\xa0per\xa0cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough quarterly growth in Korea, for example, had slowed a little since 2005.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe weakness of investment in several Asian countries since the financial crisis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the second half of the 1990s was likely to crimp growth prospects somewhat\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the future.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEconomic performance in the euro area had been improving this year after a period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof underperformance in the previous two years. Industrial production was now\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trising by over 4\xa0per\xa0cent and measures of consumer and business confidence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased steadily over the past year or so. GDP growth over the year to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe June quarter had picked up to around 2¼\xa0per\xa0cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the UK, GDP growth was higher than in continental Europe over the year to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJune quarter, at 2.8\xa0per\xa0cent. The pattern of economic growth had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texhibited some similarities with that in Australia in recent years, but in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe UK there had been a degree of buoyancy in the housing sector recently that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad not been present in Australia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to consensus forecasts, growth in the world economy was expected to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove average for the fifth consecutive year in 2007, at around 4¾\xa0per\xa0cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich would be only modestly lower than the fast pace likely to be recorded\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor 2006. Members observed that the average growth rate for the world economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been drifting up in recent years as the share of the world economy represented\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the advanced economies declined and that of emerging economies, such as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChina and India, grew.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe crude oil price had remained around US$60 per barrel over the past month. This\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas more than 20\xa0per\xa0cent lower than the peak reached around the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime of the Middle East conflict in August.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDomestic Conditions\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTwo topics provided the initial focus of discussion on domestic economic conditions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe first was the recently released ABS data on productivity growth from the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannual national accounts, in particular how these might be relevant to reconciling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe relatively low GDP growth rate reported for the year to June with other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicators that had shown rising growth rates in the first half of 2006, notably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployment growth. The latest productivity data, which indicated that average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannual growth in productivity between 2003/04 and 2005/06 was 0.6\xa0per\xa0cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevised up from the 0.1\xa0per\xa0cent reported in the quarterly national\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccounts, went a small way to providing an answer but still left a puzzle.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis could not be satisfactorily resolved by disaggregating the data by industry,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough employment growth in the market sector was lower than that in the non-market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector. If genuine, the productivity data suggested the potential growth of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Australian economy was lower than previously thought. But it was also possible\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the puzzle eventually would be at least partly resolved by further upward\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevisions to GDP growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe second topic was interest rates, in particular an examination of various benchmarks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto assess the stance of monetary policy, should the recommendation to increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cash rate at this meeting be adopted. These comparisons indicated that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cash rate in November (following a tightening of 25 basis points) would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe noticeably above the average since 1993 and over the past decade. However,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe effective rate on housing loans, i.e. taking account of discounts prevalent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the market, would be around the average since 1993 and only about 70 basis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints above the average over the past decade. The effective rate on business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tloans would be lower than the average since 1993 and over the past decade,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting increased competition in that area of lending.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the standard high-frequency indicators of economic activity, retail sales\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere soft in September, though annual growth in the value of retail sales remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat around 6\xa0per\xa0cent. Growth in recent months had slowed only for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsales by small retailers; annual growth in sales by large retailers had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom 3–4\xa0per\xa0cent earlier to over 6\xa0per\xa0cent in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast few months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConsumer sentiment had increased in September and October after falling sharply in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAugust, to be slightly above average. The volatility of this series made short-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmovements difficult to interpret, but the broad movement over the past year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicated that sentiment had declined to a level that was close to average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter having been well above average in the previous few years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the housing sector, construction activity appeared to be around its trough of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis cycle. Building approvals, particularly for houses, were bottoming out\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin all states except Western Australia, where approvals continued to trend\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup. This suggested that housing activity would begin to provide a small positive\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timpetus to overall growth in the year ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the secondary housing market, house prices were mostly flat in the September quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapart from in Perth, where they continued to increase very rapidly. Auction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclearance rates had declined since mid year in both Sydney and Melbourne.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHousing finance approvals had been lower in August and September, which implied somewhat\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsofter housing credit growth in the December quarter. Monthly growth in household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit had eased back to around 1\xa0per\xa0cent, following strengthening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the first half of the year; annual growth in household credit was running\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat 12–13\xa0per\xa0cent. Members discussed the sustainability of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe current pace of debt accumulation in the household sector, concluding that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit was difficult to determine the appropriate pace of debt accumulation, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat it could well continue around the current rate for some time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness credit growth was running at around 16\xa0per\xa0cent per annum, though\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat was below the peak rate reached earlier in the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the trade sector, base metals prices had remained high in the past month\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand were more than 60\xa0per\xa0cent higher over the year to date. Export\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treceipts had increased in the September quarter, though most of this rise continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto reflect higher prices rather than higher volumes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn further confirmation of the healthy condition of the labour market, employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased strongly in September. The run of recent monthly increases had taken\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe year-ended growth rate to 2.7\xa0per\xa0cent. The unemployment rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained at 4.8\xa0per\xa0cent, its lowest level in three decades. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that a weaker run of monthly figures could well occur before long.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCapacity utilisation in the September quarter, as measured by the NAB survey of non-farm\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusinesses, had risen to its highest level since the inception of the survey\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the late 1980s. Capacity utilisation was high across most industries. Labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshortages, as indicated by the NAB survey and other business surveys, were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso creating capacity strains.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe CPI data for the September quarter indicated that inflation had remained relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh, at 0.7\xa0per\xa0cent in the quarter and 3.9\xa0per\xa0cent over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe year. The year-ended result had been affected by rising petrol prices and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery large price rises for bananas. Abstracting from these temporary factors,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto remove the effect of outliers on both sides of the distribution of price\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanges, it was apparent that underlying inflation had increased since the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeginning of the year and in recent quarters had been running at an annual\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate of around 3\xa0per\xa0cent. Price increases at the producer level\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been intensifying also: domestic producer prices increased by more than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4\xa0per\xa0cent over the year to the September quarter, and prices of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timported items were flat following several years of price declines.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPetrol prices had fallen only slightly in the September quarter, but a large fall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas projected for the December quarter, based on daily retail petrol prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor October and recent crude oil prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board was briefed on the revised staff forecast for inflation following receipt\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the prices data for the September quarter. The outlook for underlying inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas for it to remain around its recent level of around 3\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the next two years. Headline inflation was forecast to fall to below 2\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduring 2007 and thereafter to rise to be the same as the underlying rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\nInformation Paper – The Drought\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were briefed on the staffs assessment of the probable effects of the current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrought on overall GDP growth and the inflation outlook. The severity of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrought was clear when considered from the perspective of both average rainfall,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich measured dryness, and the total area of rainfall deficiency (i.e. rainfall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow the 10th percentile), which measured how widespread drought conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere. In particular, these indicators were most striking when looked at in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms of five-year averages, which indicated the persistence of drought conditions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLevels of stored water in non-metropolitan areas, which were important for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe viability of irrigated summer crops, had not recovered from the effects\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the previous drought in 2002; the dry conditions had been exacerbated by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta noticeable rise in average temperatures in agricultural areas in recent years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUpdated forecasts of the reduction in supply of rural produce as a result of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrought had been provided by ABARE. The forecasts indicated a decline in farm\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP of around 20\xa0per\xa0cent, slightly smaller than the decline in farm\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP in 2002/03 as on this occasion livestock production was expected to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tless adversely affected. This would translate to a fall in overall GDP growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof ½ of a percentage point, with flow-on and indirect effects subtracting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta further ¼ of a percentage point, though the indirect effects could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe mitigated by government subsidies and various income-support measures.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe effect of the drought on the inflation outlook was quite modest in total. Past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texperience suggested that the net effect of drought on prices was fairly small,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas in the first instance rises in the prices of some items (e.g. cereals) were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\troughly offset by falls in prices of others (e.g. meat), and several of these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffects tended to be reversed in the period following drought. More generally,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince the current drought would reduce GDP primarily by reducing the economy's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupply capacity, the reduction in growth associated with the drought would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot in itself do much to assist in relieving capacity constraints in the wider\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFinancial Markets and the Bank's Operations\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the past month, official interest rates in Europe had been increased. The ECB\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased its official rate to 3¼\xa0per\xa0cent and the Swedish\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcentral bank raised rates to 2¾\xa0per\xa0cent. Interest rates in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEurope were still relatively low and further increases in the months ahead\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere expected.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Bank of Japan had not changed official interest rates since June. Although rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere still very low and the Bank of Japan had signalled an intention to raise\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem further in due course, there was very little inflation in Japan at present.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the US, the Fed also had not changed interest rates since June. It had been trying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto counter market expectations that it would soon cut interest rates. Given\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent strong data on the labour market, markets currently did not expect the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFed to cut rates in the next six months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe RBNZ and Bank of England were expected to tighten monetary policy in the next\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfew months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLong-term interest rates had fallen noticeably since the middle of the year. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10-year bond yield in the US was around 4.7\xa0per\xa0cent, significantly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow the federal funds rate. Rather than suggesting a severe slowing in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS economy and easing of monetary policy, it was more likely that longer-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyields were still being pushed down by a surplus of savings, particularly from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAsia. Long-term bond yields in Asia were now lower than those in the US, despite\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher credit risk and lower market liquidity.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe US share market had picked up noticeably in recent months and was 10\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher this year. The decline in bond yields had probably contributed to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent increases, but company earnings had continued to surprise on the upside.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShare markets in Europe had also been strong in the past few months. Apart\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the Japanese share market, which had shown little net change in 2006 following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sharp rise in 2005, most other countries' share markets had risen by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10–15\xa0per\xa0cent this year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe US dollar continued to be relatively steady on a trade-weighted basis, around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t25–30\xa0per\xa0cent below the peak in 2002.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe yen, on the other hand, had continued to decline, with the real value of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurrency having fallen to the lowest level since the mid 1980s. The decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the real exchange rate had reflected the combined effect of the fall in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe nominal exchange rate and the decade of low inflation or deflation. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyen was pushed down as a consequence of the outflow of money from Japanese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestors, who were seeking a better return than that available on domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassets. The healthier real economy had given investors greater confidence to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake on the foreign exchange risk associated with investment offshore. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower exchange rate was a key channel for the easy monetary policy stance to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstimulate the economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Chinese authorities had continued to raise the exchange rate of the renminbi\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the US dollar, with a net appreciation since mid 2005 of 5\xa0per\xa0cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, on a trade-weighted basis the currency was still relatively low because\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the fall, together with the US dollar, against other major currencies between\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2002 and 2004.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Australia, financial markets had fully priced in an interest rate increase at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis meeting of the Board. Expectations of tightening had increased following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe strong employment report for September and the high CPI outcome for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSeptember quarter. Markets saw a 30\xa0per\xa0cent chance of a further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate rise in February.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been little movement in longer-term yields over the past month. The 10-year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbond yield was around 5¾\xa0per\xa0cent, below the cash rate, as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas also the case in the US.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecent increases in interest rates and market expectations of further rises were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstarting to have an effect on home loan borrowers. The proportion of loan approvals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat fixed rates had risen to 20\xa0per\xa0cent, with most of these approvals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor loans fixed for three years. There was no cost to fixing the loan rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor three years as the interest rate of 7¼\xa0per\xa0cent was around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe same as the rate on offer for discounted variable rate loans at present.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLoan repayment arrears and repossessions remained very low.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian share market rose sharply in October and was 15\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher since the start of the year. The rise of 5\xa0per\xa0cent in October,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was larger than the international average, was boosted by higher commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices, strong company profits and a number of company-specific events.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnalysts had begun to revise up again their estimates for profit growth in the year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tahead; apart from a brief period recently, for the past three years analysts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave continually had to revise up their estimates of profits in the year ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA similar pattern, but not to the same extent, had been seen in the US.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe overall price-earnings ratio for the Australian market had fallen over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfew years, reflecting share prices rising by less than profits. The current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tP/E ratio appeared to be around the average of the past decade or so, as did\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe dividend yield. This suggested the overall market was fairly valued, on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe assumption that the current level of profits would be maintained.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been a pick-up in mergers and acquisitions activity recently; over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast year, such activity was running at around four times the rate of a few\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears earlier. There had also been a sharp rise in leveraged buy-out activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the past year, but the amount of money involved remained small relative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto share-market capitalisation. This pick-up, which had been driven by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuse of relatively cheap debt finance to increase gearing of some companies,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmay have also encouraged some companies to increase their gearing in an attempt\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto reduce the risk of take-over. However, following the increase, aggregate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorporate gearing had only moved back towards the longer-run average, following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe low levels reached in recent years. Moreover, most of the increase in gearing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been undertaken by companies that had previously been lowly geared, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe gearing of mining companies had fallen because the addition to equity capital\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom retained earnings had exceeded the increase in debt. These observations\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested that developments in corporate gearing to date did not pose concerns.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe five major Australian banks had now all announced their profits for the 2005/06\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial year, mostly ending in September (except for the CBA, whose financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear ended in June). The banks had been important beneficiaries of the good\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic performance of recent years. Underlying profits had risen by over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t20\xa0per\xa0cent in the year. After-tax return on equity of the major\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks was 18\xa0per\xa0cent, boosted slightly by some accounting changes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the definition of equity following the introduction of AIFRS. The decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin interest spreads that had occurred over the past decade had levelled out\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the most recent year, around levels that were comparable internationally.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCompetitive pressures had continued on loan rates, but this had not been reflected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin spreads as banks had not raised some deposit rates in line with increases\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin official interest rates. The banks had continued to cut costs, inducing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta sharp fall in the aggregate cost-to-income ratio. Bad debt charges, as a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpercentage of loans, had remained low, but the steady fall seen over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfew years had levelled out.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian dollar had risen to around US77 cents over the past month, towards\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe upper end of the range of the past two to three years. Recently, it had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen supported by positive economic news, higher commodity prices and increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectations of a further tightening of monetary policy. The TWI had also risen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto around the top of its recent range. The main movement of the Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar recently had been against the yen, with the current exchange rate above\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t90 yen, which was the highest in a decade. This reflected the weakness of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyen internationally.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\nConsiderations for Monetary Policy\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recommendation to the Board was for an increase in the cash rate of 25 basis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints to 6.25\xa0per\xa0cent in November.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe main international factors in the Board's consideration of the recommendation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere that growth was likely to continue at an above-average rate in 2007, even\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith a slowing in the US. On the domestic side, though the effects of the earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreases in the cash rate in Australia were yet to have their full effect,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe staff forecast for underlying inflation in Australia was for it to remain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround 3\xa0per\xa0cent over the next two years. High levels of commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices were continuing to add to domestic incomes and spending, capacity utilisation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas at record levels and the labour market remained tight. The Board took careful\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnote of the likely economic effects of the drought, noting in particular that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit was unlikely to affect significantly the medium-term outlook for inflation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board took account of the two increases in the cash rate earlier in the year,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand noted that there was some evidence that those measures were affecting the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand for credit. Nonetheless, the Board judged that the risk of inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texceeding 2–3\xa0per\xa0cent in the medium term remained significant.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt believed that a somewhat more restrictive stance of policy, by taking some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressure off demand, would improve the prospects of bringing inflation back\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttowards 2½\xa0per\xa0cent in due course.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers also discussed the merits of tightening by 50 basis points, given that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffect on inflation of a single 25 basis point tightening was normally thought\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be modest. On balance, members decided that the smaller move would be appropriate,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor several reasons. First, the effect on inflation would reflect the accumulation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the three tightenings in 2006, and there was a degree of uncertainty as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto how well the forecasts were able to account for the earlier measures. Secondly,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgiven that a 25 basis point increase was widely anticipated by financial markets,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta larger increase could prompt some unwelcome disruption and lead to unpredictable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffects on expectations. Overall, the Board judged that a 25 basis point rise\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould leave policy with adequate flexibility to move further in the months\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tahead if needed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Decision\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board decided that the cash rate should be increased by 25 basis points to 6.25\xa0per\xa0cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffective the following day.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nRelated Information\n\n\nMedia Release 2006-11 | Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary\xa0Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for email and SMS alerts\nSubscribe\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\nFlickr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiliate sites\n\nBanknotes\nUnreserved\nMuseum\nCouncil of Financial Regulators\nAustralian Foreign Exchange Committee\nH.C.
