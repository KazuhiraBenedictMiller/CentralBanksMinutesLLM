Weighted by shares of Australia's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texports, the GDP of Australia's trading partners had increased by 4.7\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past year, which was a modest slowing from 2005. Looking ahead, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmain question analysts were focusing on was the extent to which the slowing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the US economy would affect the world economy as a whole.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the US, the latest data suggested that growth had slowed further in recent months\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the average 3½\xa0per\xa0cent pace of recent years. The housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector remained the key to near-term prospects for overall growth. Construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity was currently forecast to fall by around 20\xa0per\xa0cent, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould fall by more given that housing starts had now declined by 30\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince the peaks at the start of the year. The consensus view was that GDP growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould slow to around 2½\xa0per\xa0cent, but recent data suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome downside risk to this expectation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHouse prices in the US appeared to have peaked and had been flat for much of 2006,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccording to the average of the available measures; median prices, which are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taffected by compositional change, had fallen, while a repeat-sales index, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texcluded compositional shifts, was beginning to level out. An important consideration\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor policy-makers was how the wealth effects associated with slowing –\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor even falling – house prices would affect household spending. While\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tretail sales had softened in recent months, aggregate measures of personal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption had not slowed much so far during 2006, and had been underpinned\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the strong labour market, which had supported healthy growth in incomes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in other parts of the US economy had continued to be strong. Corporate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprofits had increased by 30\xa0per\xa0cent over the year to the September\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter and represented a rising share of GDP, and business investment was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trobust.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe latest data on inflation in the US indicated that the headline rate had fallen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto 1¼\xa0per\xa0cent, reflecting the influence of falling oil prices,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich has a particularly large effect on the US CPI as the small tax component\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin retail gasoline prices leads to proportionally larger changes in the latter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas oil prices change. The core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad eased from just under 3\xa0per\xa0cent to 2¾\xa0per\xa0cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis was regarded by the Fed as still uncomfortably high, and the likely future\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrend in this measure would be key for the conduct of US monetary policy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in Japanese GDP was solid in the September quarter, though not as high as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier in the year. The expansion was continuing, with business investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowing strongly, consumer confidence high and the labour market healthy. Following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevisions, the core CPI was running at about −½\xa0per\xa0cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was making the Bank of Japan cautious in considering further monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy adjustments.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, growth in industrial production had eased to around 15\xa0per\xa0cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing a spike close to 20\xa0per\xa0cent and generally higher rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof growth in the past year or two. Good growth in GDP had been recorded in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost east Asian economies in the September quarter after a soft patch around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe middle of the year. Over the past few years, China had become as important\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta destination for exports of east Asian economies as the US, but members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat China would not be immune to the effects of the slowdown in the US. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshare of Japanese exports to China had also risen in recent years, to be about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe same as for Europe, though the US remained a more important export destination.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEconomic growth in the euro area had continued to pick up gradually, with year-ended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in GDP stable at around 2½\xa0per\xa0cent in the September\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIndia had recorded very strong growth over the past year or so, and GDP had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby more than 9\xa0per\xa0cent over the year to the September quarter. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsize of the Indian economy was less than half that of China on a purchasing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower parity basis, but together these two economies were steadily becoming\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore important parts of the world economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe crude oil price had moved above US$60 per barrel over the past month. This had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen attributed to the effect of a cold snap in the US and the response by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets to production cuts proposed by OPEC.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDomestic Conditions\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were informed that information received in the past few days had led to a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevised estimate of GDP growth in the September quarter. The latest data for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkey partial indicators of expenditure and income suggested that quarterly output\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth was now more likely to be around ½\xa0per\xa0cent than the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1\xa0per\xa0cent noted in the Board paper.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRetail sales increased solidly in October and year-ended growth had been steady at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout 6\xa0per\xa0cent since early 2006. Annual growth in sales by large\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tretailers had been higher than that for small retailers for most of the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the housing sector, building approvals for both houses and medium-density dwellings\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfell in October, though some correction from earlier increases had been likely.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApprovals in individual States were volatile and disparate trends across the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry were apparent. Vacancy rates for rental dwellings had declined further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin recent months and, in most capital cities, were around the low levels reached\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin previous cycles. In all, recent housing-related data were consistent with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction activity having reached a trough, and a modest pick-up in activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the year ahead was expected.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNationwide house prices had increased in the September quarter, according to ABS\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata, which were somewhat stronger than those recently sourced from APM. House\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices had risen in all capital cities except Sydney, where they remained relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflat; prices continued to rise at an unsustainably fast pace in Perth, being\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t46\xa0per\xa0cent higher over the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to an assessment of domestic financial conditions, with a longer perspective\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit was apparent that the most recent pattern, i.e. where business credit was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowing more rapidly than household credit, had been the norm during most of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe 1980s. The string of corporate collapses following the boom in the late\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1980s had prompted a decade and a half of conservative balance-sheet management\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas businesses had aimed to keep gearing low. This situation was now changing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the current period of businesses gearing up could run for a while. In recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths, household credit growth had begun to slow, and this could be seen in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth the monthly credit growth and loan approvals figures, in the latter case\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly in approvals to investors, which were down from their peaks earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness investment was estimated to have fallen in the September quarter, and in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear-ended terms and on a national accounts basis, growth was likely to have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen below 5\xa0per\xa0cent. This had followed annual growth rates of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10–20\xa0per\xa0cent since 2002. Expectations of investment spending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the year ahead indicated that spending was likely to be flat, at a high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel. Business investment as a share of GDP had been trending up for the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfive years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCommodity prices had been stable recently, but the main feature was the extent of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rise over the past three years: measured in domestic and foreign currency\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms, commodity prices had increased by 70–80\xa0per\xa0cent since\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlate 2003. Base metals prices had increased by around 50\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the early part of 2006, and following a correction after the peak in May,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappeared to have resumed an upward trend since the middle of the year. Rural\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommodity prices were displaying the effects of the drought, with both wheat\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand wool prices rising sharply over the past 12–18 months. This was similar\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the experience during the 2002 drought.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe current account deficit was estimated to have fallen in the September quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdriven by a decline in the trade deficit to around ½\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof GDP. However, the latest data were not seen as heralding a trend decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the current account deficit, as monthly trade data suggested the deficit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould widen again in the short term.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the labour market, a correction to the run of very strong monthly employment growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcame with a significant decline in estimated employment and labour force participation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin October. Year-ended employment growth remained above 2\xa0per\xa0cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was still high relative to the recent pace of GDP growth. Unemployment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfell to 4.6\xa0per\xa0cent. Business surveys indicated that labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions were still tight, with small and medium businesses continuing to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treport that difficulty finding quality staff was a greater concern than a lack\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof work or sales.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe wage price index indicated that wages growth had fallen to 0.8\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the September quarter and 3.8\xa0per\xa0cent over the year. These figures,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich were lower than the recent pace of wages growth of over 4\xa0per\xa0cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflected the changed timing of the minimum wage increase this year. Adjusting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor this, in underlying terms wages growth had remained stable at just over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4\xa0per\xa0cent, having increased slowly from around 3\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past eight years. Broadly the same picture was evident from the data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton wage increases from enterprise agreements.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe sharp fall in petrol prices in recent months was expected to subtract ¾\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpercentage point from the CPI in the December quarter. This implied that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\theadline CPI rise was likely to be close to zero in the quarter; the CPI data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be released by the ABS in late January.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board was briefed on the revised inflation outlook following the latest data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton wages and taking account of the November interest rate increase. The underlying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate of inflation was now expected to increase a bit further in the short term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton a year-ended basis, and then drift down towards 2¾\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the next two years. Headline inflation was forecast to decline sharply\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the next year and thereafter to rise to be the same as the underlying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFinancial Markets and the Bank's Operations\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDiscussion of conditions in financial markets began with some assessment of the state\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof markets globally.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere were four main observations. First, the world remained in a low-interest rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenvironment, with policy interest rates in a majority of countries still below\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage. Australia was one of the few countries with its policy rate above\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe average prevailing since 1993, which was the start of the current low-inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod. It was mainly the English-speaking countries that had rates above average.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSecondly, the return on equity was high and the cost of debt low, and this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas providing a major impetus to the re-gearing of the corporate sector globally,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the private equity boom being one symptom of this. Thirdly, perceived\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisks remained low, as indicated by default rates on debt, which were at historical\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlows, and lower volatility in financial markets. Taken together, these phenomena\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad produced a very benign environment for financial markets.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the regular update on current developments in financial markets, the main\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisk worrying markets at present was that the US economy would slow more than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected and that the slowing would spread to other countries. In recent months,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets had viewed this concern as greater than the risk of a resurgence of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation. Markets thought it was likely that the Fed would cut the Fed funds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate in the first half of 2007, though the Fed had been trying to convey a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmessage that such expectations were premature.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe 10-year bond yield in the US had fallen back to around 4.4\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the past month, which was the same level prevailing a year earlier. Bond\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyields in Europe and Japan had also fallen; in Europe, the decline in bond\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyields had come despite expectations that the ECB would tighten monetary policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagain at its next meeting. Recent movements in bond yields indicated that markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthought that the global interest rate cycle was reaching a peak.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Chinese authorities had tightened monetary policy further, mainly by raising\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe required reserve ratio on banks. Interest rates had risen from the very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlow level prevailing in the second half of 2005, but were still below 3\xa0per\xa0cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBank liquidity was high in China, reflecting the effect of foreign exchange\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintervention by the People's Bank of China.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe US share market rose early in November but declined later in the month following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release of softer than expected economic data. Overall, the market had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen relatively strong, having risen by 12\xa0per\xa0cent over the year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto date. It was still 8\xa0per\xa0cent below its peak in 2000.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShare prices had also been strong in other countries during 2006, noticeably so in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEurope, where the rise had been 17\xa0per\xa0cent over the year to date.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese market had fallen slightly this year but the fall had followed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta very strong rise in 2005. Share markets in emerging markets were ending 2006\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin a strong position after a mid-year shake-out. These markets had risen by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t20–25\xa0per\xa0cent over 2006 to date, after even larger rises in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2005 as improving economic conditions had become apparent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe US dollar had fallen significantly during November and early December. This had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmainly been because of softer US economic data, though the fall had come against\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe background of concerns that Asian countries might diversify reserves holdings\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taway from the US and towards Europe. The US dollar was close to the low point\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the euro that was reached in late 2004. The fall against the yen had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen more modest. On a trade-weighted basis, the US dollar had fallen a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the past month and by 7\xa0per\xa0cent over 2006 to date, but was no\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower than in late 2004. Taking a longer perspective, the broad trade-weighted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindex in real terms, i.e. taking account of differences in inflation in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS and its trading partners, was currently around its average level of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast 30 years, and at least 10\xa0per\xa0cent above the lows reached in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe early 1990s. The fall in the US dollar had resulted in the Chinese authorities\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallowing the renminbi to rise slightly faster against it than in the past.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Australia, financial markets had fully anticipated the interest rate increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing the November meeting of the Board, and the announcement had little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther effect. Short-term yields had not changed much since then, and current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyields implied no expectation of a further tightening of monetary policy in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe next few months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLonger-term interest rates in Australia had fallen, as they had in most other countries,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough the falls had not been as large as there was not the same concern as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the US that the economy was losing momentum.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian share market had been a little more volatile during November than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the previous few months, but ended the month slightly higher. Resource shares\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad fallen in the month, reflecting concern about the possibility of a slowdown\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the US and the wider implications that would flow from that, but other sectors\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the share market had risen further. The market overall had risen by 15\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the year to date, which was another strong outcome. After including dividends,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe increase for the year to date was close to 20\xa0per\xa0cent, the fourth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsecutive year of strong returns. In fact, returns had been strong and stable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor over a decade, with only one year of negative returns in the past 12 years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis had been underpinned by the solid and consistent growth of the economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand company profits.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCompany analysts had continued to revise up their estimates for overall profit growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the year ahead, though within the aggregate, estimates of profit growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof resource companies had been revised down.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDespite the recent further rises in share prices, the current P/E ratio continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be in line with long-run averages and slightly below the average for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlow-inflation period. Dividend yields had also been maintained around average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian dollar had risen further against the declining US dollar in the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth, and had returned to the top of the trading range of the past three years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough the Australian dollar had fallen slightly against the euro, in trade-weighted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms the Australian dollar was higher over the past month. At its current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel, the TWI was also around its highs of recent years and about 10\xa0per\xa0cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove its long-run average. The current level of the TWI reflected the fact\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the Australian dollar had increased significantly against Asian currencies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past 20 years; it had depreciated a little against other major currencies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover that period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\nConsiderations for Monetary Policy\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board noted that the November increase had been relatively well accepted by financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets and the community. The recommendation to the Board was for no change\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the cash rate in December.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe data on economic activity in the US had been a little weaker over the past month,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough at this stage the outlook for the world economy was still for growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto continue at an above-average rate in 2007. The latest data on economic conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Australia had been mixed, with the most recent run of data on activity and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincomes being quite moderate and further signs of easing in the demand for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinance on the part of households.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe updated staff forecast for underlying inflation, taking into account the November\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttightening, was for it to remain around 3\xa0per\xa0cent in the near term,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen to decline gradually, to 2¾ per\xa0cent over the ensuing year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor two. Board members also noted some risk that inflation could remain stubbornly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh. Despite the well-behaved nature of the latest data on wages growth, members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted an apparent slowing of productivity growth. On the other hand, risks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof inflation expectations rising would be lowered by the sharp fall in headline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation in prospect over the year ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOverall, the Board judged that with the existing stance of policy mildly restrictive,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere was time to assess trends in the world and domestic economies over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsummer before considering further action.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Decision\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board decided that the cash rate should remain at 6.25\xa0per\xa0cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Back to top\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for email and SMS alerts\nSubscribe\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\nFlickr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiliate sites\n\nBanknotes\nUnreserved\nMuseum\nCouncil of Financial Regulators\nAustralian Foreign Exchange Committee\nH.C.
